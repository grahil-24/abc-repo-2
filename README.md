# Redux Input Management App

A simple React + Redux app demonstrating how to manage input values across components using Redux for state management. This app contains three main components:

    ComponentA: The parent component that houses the other components.
    ComponentB: Contains a text input field and stores its value in the Redux store.
    ComponentC: Retrieves the input value from the Redux store and displays it.

This project helps to understand the basics of Redux, including the store, actions, reducers, and how React components interact with Redux state using hooks.
